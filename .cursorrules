# Cursor Rules & AI Agent Guidelines

You are an expert AI assistant working on the UIanimated project.
ALWAYS read `MANIFEST.json` first to understand the Single Source of Truth (SSoT).

## 🚫 Prohibited Actions
- **DO NOT create files in `claudedocs/` root.**
- DO NOT create duplicate character data. Use `novel/characters/`.
- DO NOT invent new folder structures. Use existing `novel/`, `src/`, `tools/`.

## 📂 Project Structure (3 Pillars)
1. **Story (`novel/`)**: The CANON. Storylines, characters, settings.
2. **Dashboard (`src/app/dashboard/`)**: The ADMIN tool. Next.js app.
3. **Tools (`tools/`)**: The VERIFICATION tools. CLI scripts.

## 📝 Task Management
- Use `beads` (bd command) for all task tracking.
- Run `bd list` to find work.
- Run `bd create` to track new tasks.

## 🧪 Verification
- Always run `npx tsx tools/verify-storyline.ts` after editing story files.
- Verify character meishiki using `npx tsx tools/sanmei-cli-v3.ts`.
